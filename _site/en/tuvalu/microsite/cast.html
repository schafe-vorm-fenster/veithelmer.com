                        Denis Lavant completed his acting training at the National Conservatory for Drama in Paris 
                        and became one of France's best-known theater actors. His breakthrough on screen came with 
                        three productions by Leos Carax, with the last, "Les Amants du Pont Neuf," bringing him 
                        international recognition. For TUVALU, he was chosen as best actor at the "Faces of Love"

                        absolutely no difference where you live, whether in Russia, France or America. As long as 
                        we speak the same language — without words — we understand each other. That fascinates me 
                        about this film: the form of communication where language is no longer important."</i>

                        Through leading roles in the films "Vremya Tantsora" and "Strana Gluhich" (The Land of Silence), 
                        Chulpan Hamatova drew attention to herself. Today, at 24, she is a star in her homeland. 
                        She played the lead role alongside Moritz Bleibtreu in the film "Papa Luna" by Bakhtyar 
                        Khudojnazarov. For the role of "Eva" in Veit Helmer's film "TUVALU," she was chosen as best
