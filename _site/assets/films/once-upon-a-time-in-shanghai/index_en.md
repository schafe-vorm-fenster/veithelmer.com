ONCE UPON A TIME IN SHANGHAI documents a vanishing world: a densely populated neighborhood in Baku, Azerbaijan, known locally as "Shanghai," where the railway tracks pass mere meters from residential buildings. Here, life takes place in the intimate space between home and train—laundry hanging across the tracks, children playing on the rails, and neighbors socializing in the path of passing locomotives.

This poetic documentary serves as both a companion piece and a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Veit Helmer's feature film THE BRA (2018), which was filmed in this remarkable location. But it is far more than a making-of documentary—it is a loving portrait of a community and a way of life on the verge of extinction.

Through Veit Helmer's observational lens and Felix Leiberg's evocative cinematography, we meet the residents of Shanghai: the people who have made their lives in this extraordinary place where the rhythms of the railway define daily existence. Every day, when the train approaches, a young orphan boy blows a whistle, warning residents to quickly bring themselves and their belongings to safety—a ritual that has become second nature.

Shot with Helmer's characteristic sensitivity and visual poetry, the documentary captures the community's resilience, humor, and humanity. The neighborhood's nickname "Shanghai" speaks to its density and vibrancy, reminiscent of the bustling Chinese metropolis.

Shortly after the filming of THE BRA concluded, the Shanghai neighborhood was demolished as part of urban development, making this documentary a precious historical record of a unique place that no longer exists. It stands as a testament to the lives lived there and the indomitable spirit of its inhabitants.
