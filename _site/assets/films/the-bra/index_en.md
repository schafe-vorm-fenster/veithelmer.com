A freight train rolls through a vast grassy landscape that stretches along the Caucasian mountains. At the wheel: Nurlan, the train driver. Day in, day out, he steers his train through a densely populated suburb of Baku, where the tracks are so close to the houses that Nurlan practically drives through the inhabitants' anterooms and gardens.

On his daily route, he passes men drinking tea as well as women hanging their laundry in the gentle wind. As soon as the train approaches, the little orphan boy Aziz blows a whistle and the inhabitants of the suburb quickly bring themselves and their belongings to safety. But this does not always succeed. Nurlan has already plucked many a thing from his locomotive: chicken feathers, toy balls or even duvet covers.

On his last day of work before retirement, a special farewell gift gets caught on Nurlan's locomotive: a dreamily beautiful, blue lace bra. Nurlan takes it to his home village in the mountains after his shift. His curiosity is piqued: to whom could this small piece of fabric belong? Driven by loneliness, Nurlan decides to take up the search for the owner of the bra.

THE BRA is a story about the search for love, told with great sensitivity and lightheartedness. Once again, director Veit Helmer is drawn to the mountain landscape of Azerbaijan. In his masterfully imaginative visual language, he lives up to his reputation as a modern storyteller and stages the story of THE BRA as an atmospheric comedy that gets by entirely without dialogue and captivates us precisely because of it.
