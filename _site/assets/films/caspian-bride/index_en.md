A lonesome man takes a ride to a dump in search for usable things.

Hidden under a lot of rubbish he finds an old mannequin. He takes her along to his hut, washes and clothes her. He shaves and goes on a bike tour through the oil fields. When a group of children runs after him, he collides with a flock of sheep. The mannequin sinks in a puddle of oil. This story could have a sad ending ... But at that moment he encounters his true love.
