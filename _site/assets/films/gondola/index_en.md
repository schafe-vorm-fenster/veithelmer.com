In the mountains of Georgia, a cable car connects a remote village with the valley town below. Iva works as a cable car attendant at the upper station, while Nino operates the gondola from the lower station. Every half hour, their cabins pass each other mid-journey, offering brief moments of connection.

What begins as casual greetings through the windows gradually transforms into something deeper. Through gestures, glances, and small acts of kindness, Iva and Nino develop a tender romance despite the physical distance that separates them. The cable car becomes both their connection and their constraint, as they find creative ways to communicate and express their growing affection.

GONDOLA is a celebration of visual storytelling, conveying deep emotion entirely without dialogue. Director Veit Helmer, known for his poetic and imaginative approach, crafts a fairytale-like romance that speaks to the universal language of love and longing. Giorgi Devdariani's cinematography captures the stunning Georgian mountain landscapes and the intimate spaces of the cable cars with equal beauty, while the expressive musical score by Sóley Stefánsdóttir and Malcolm Arison enhances the film's dreamlike atmosphere.

Rich in symbolism and atmosphere, GONDOLA proves that the most profound connections often require no words at all.
