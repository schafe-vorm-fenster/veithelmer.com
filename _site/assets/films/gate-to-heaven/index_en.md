Veit Helmer's second feature film "Gate to Heaven" (starring Miki Manojlović and Udo Kier) was filmed in 2002 at Frankfurt Airport.

The film tells the story of people living in the gray zone of the transit area of a large international airport - a modern fairy tale about dreams, hope, and life between worlds.

## The Story

In the no-man's-land of a large international airport's transit area, destinies from all over the world meet. Here, where time seems to stand still and usual rules don't apply, unusual friendships and absurd situations emerge.

The protagonists – refugees, businessmen, dreamers – all are trapped in this in-between space, between departure and arrival, between yesterday and tomorrow. They develop their own survival strategies and create a small parallel world with its own laws.

With much humor and poetry, "Gate to Heaven" tells of humanity's ability to maintain hope even under the most adverse circumstances and make the best of any situation.
