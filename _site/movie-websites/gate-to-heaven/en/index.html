                            Frankfurt Airport – Gateway to the World. Thousands of travelers pass through 
                            every day, but only a few remain: the inhabitants of the transit zone, 
                            people without papers, refugees waiting for their destiny.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Among them is <strong>Nisha</strong> (Masumi Makhija), a young Indian woman 
                            who has been stranded at the airport for months. She lives in a hidden world 
                            beneath the terminals, where an unusual community has formed – people from 
                            all corners of the world united by their stateless existence.
                        </p>

                            When Russian pilot <strong>Alexej</strong> (Valera Nikolaev) discovers the 
                            underground world, he falls in love with Nisha. But their love seems impossible – 
                            he belongs to the world outside, she is trapped in the airport's purgatory.

                            "Gate to Heaven" is a poetic fairy tale about love, freedom, and the longing 
                            for home – told without words, in Veit Helmer's signature visual style.
