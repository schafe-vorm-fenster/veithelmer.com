The workshop is aimed at film students and young filmmakers just starting out. The aim of the workshops is the production of a 35mm short film (5-7 minutes) without dialogue. The workshop will run along the lines of the principle of “learning by doing”. 16-18 people may take part in a workshop.

The workshop is divided into seven phases:

1. **Gathering ideas** (3 months before shooting): Each participant will develop an idea for a film (one page) on a subject provided by Veit Helmer via internet.
2. **Writing a screenplay** (2 months before shooting): Each participant will write a screenplay on the theme chosen by Veit Helmer
3. **Looking for a location and casting** (1 month before shooting): The participant will screen test actors and photograph possible locations
4. **Preparation**: Veit Helmer will arrive three days before shooting begins. Storyboards will be drawn up, actors rehearsed and tasks distributed.
5. **Shooting**: 3 days shooting on location. The participants will take turns at directing. Veit Helmer will advise and supervise.
6. **Editing** (1 month after shooting): Each participant will work at editing his own version. Veit Helmer will assemble the best ideas and complete a final version.
7. **Premiere and festival presentation** (4 months after shooting): The film will be premiered in a cinema. Following this the participants will travel to festivals to present the film.

The cost of a workshop is between 3000-6000 euros, depending on the country.
