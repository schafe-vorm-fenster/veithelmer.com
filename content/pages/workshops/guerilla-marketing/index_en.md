This one-day workshop is about the international distribution of independent feature films.

For many years, filmmakers have been told that for their film to be sold internationally, they need a world sales agent.

What can you do if you don't get a good offer from a world sales agent? Or no offer at all?

The digitalization of the film industry allows filmmakers to become agents for their own films.

Some films can even be sold more profitably by the producer.

In the workshop, the life cycle of a film is examined step by step and ideas are given on how producers and filmmakers can sell their films worldwide.
