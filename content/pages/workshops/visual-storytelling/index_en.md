The presentation is aimed at film students and young filmmakers just starting out. The presentation will run between 3 and 6 hours, depending on the subject. Depending on the size of the room and the loudspeaker system, there could be potentially a large audience.

**Subject matter:**
The director is like a conductor. He has an orchestra (the film team), all of whom he or she must conduct so that they can play a single composition. Many directors fail to use many of the instruments because they simply haven’t considered how they might be used and how each individual section can contribute to a specific moment in the film. However, in order to develop an individual style, one must be constantly in potential control of all instruments.

This takes as its starting principle the idea that one must be aware of the capabilities of each section. You don’t have to be able to do sound or sew costumes but you must know, for example, exactly how a make-up artist or a cameraman can influence a film.

Only when the director can pull out all the stops and manage all the ‘orchestral’ registers can he or she develop an individual style.

The various registers, the palate of possibilities, will be systematically outlined using a number of examples.
