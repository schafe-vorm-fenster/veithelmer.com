The workshop is aimed at acting students and actors who as yet have no casting experience.

The goal of the workshops is to diminish actors’ anxiety about casting sessions. During the workshops casting situations will be enacted as realistically as possible. Each participant will, during the course of the workshops, practice numerous different audition situations.

16-18 people may take part in a workshop.

The workshop is divided into three phases:

1. Introduction to the casting process.
2. Cold reading/improvisation
3. Call-back (director’s session), with video camera
4. Screening of castings, analysis and discussion

The cost of a workshop is between 1000-2000 Euros, depending on duration.
