ABSURDISTAN is Veit Helmer’s third feature film project. The script was developed with the support of Sources2 and the MFI (Mediterranean Film Institute) and of the MEDIA New Talent programme for project development. 

The idea for the film is based upon a small newspaper article: In 2001, women in the Turkish village Sirt went on strike. As long as the men didn’t repair the water pipes, they refused to have sex. Veit was fascinated by the comic and dramatic potential of the strike. Together with Gordan Mihic ("Black Cat, White Cat") and Zaza Buadze he developed the script for a love story between two teenagers in the time of war between man and women ...

Set in a remote mountain village somewhere between yesterday and tomorrow, young Temelko and his beloved Aya must defend their love against the resistance of the entire village, while the women "shut off the tap" to the men until the water flows again.
