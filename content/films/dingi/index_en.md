Homeless children are repeatedly chased away from the harbor by boatmen. But they come up with an ingenious idea to pay them back.

In this charming short film, Veit Helmer once again demonstrates his talent for visual storytelling without words. The story takes place at the busy harbor of Dhaka, where street children and boatmen are in constant conflict. With wit and ingenuity, the children develop a clever plan to fight back against injustice.
