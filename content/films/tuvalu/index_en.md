A place, far away from our world, in another time ...

The building housing a great, old pool is falling apart. 

Anton is the young apprentice to the master of the baths. His time is devoted to convincing his blind father that the pool is intact and full of customers. Anton is an eccentric loner who dreams of the open seas. 

Similar desires are shared by Eva, a beautiful eighteen year old whose eye is caught by Anton's strange ways.

A grave misunderstanding keeps the two of them from setting off in Eva's tug boat right at the beginning of the film: Eva's father is killed when he's hit by a piece of the pool's ceiling.

This misunderstanding has been set into motion by Gregor, Anton's brother, for whom the baths are a thorn in his eye. Gregor wants to the destroy the baths and the whole town and replace it with a futuristic city. No price is too high, no means too cruel — the baths must be closed so that he can tear the building down. When all his plans are botched, he turns against his father.

Anton can't save the bath, but he does win Eva's heart. Together, they take the machine from the cellar. They fix up Eva's tug boat and set out for the open sea.
