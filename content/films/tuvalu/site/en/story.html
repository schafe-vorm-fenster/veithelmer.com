                    The building housing a great, old pool is falling apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anton is the young apprentice to the master of the baths. His time is devoted to convincing 
                    his blind father that the pool is intact and full of customers. Anton is an eccentric loner 
                    who dreams of the open seas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar desires are shared by Eva, a beautiful eighteen year old whose eye is caught by 
                    Anton's strange ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A grave misunderstanding keeps the two of them from setting off in Eva's tug boat right at 
                    the beginning of the film: Eva's father is killed when he's hit by a piece of the pool's ceiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This misunderstanding has been set into motion by Gregor, Anton's brother, for whom the baths 
                    are a thorn in his eye. Gregor wants to the destroy the baths and the whole town and replace 
                    it with a futuristic city. No price is too high, no means too cruel — the baths must be closed 
                    so that he can tear the building down. When all his plans are botched, he turns against his father.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anton can't save the bath, but he does win Eva's heart. Together, they take the machine from 
                    the cellar. They fix up Eva's tug boat and set out for the open sea.
                </p>
