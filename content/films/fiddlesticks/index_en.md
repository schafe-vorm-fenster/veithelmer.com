The life of the children of Bollersdorf could be so beautiful if the place hadn't been discovered by the Society for Consumer Research because of its averageness. New products are to be tested here. What the people of Bollersdorf like can be sold well everywhere, the market researchers know. 

But while the parents of the village enthusiastically participate, their children quickly have their noses full of the annoying product testers. Especially when they want to deport their beloved grandmas and grandpas to a home so that the average age fits again. 

This is a case for the Coati Gang! Together with the clever coati Quatsch, the children hatch a clever plan: with adventurous inventions and crazy world records they want to prove Bollersdorf's uniqueness so that the consumer researchers finally disappear again...
